# RvmASM Assembler
This is the assembler for ```.rvmasm``` files. It will parse any file of that type and convert it into binary file for [Rusty-VM](https://github.com/LordAfterEight/rusty-vm/blob/master/README.md) to read. to use it, first run the following command:
```shell
cargo install rvmasm
```
Now you can use the ```rvmasm``` command to build a binary from any ```.rvmasm``` input file:
```shell
rvmasm code.rvmasm output
```

# Documentation
RvmASM is an Assembly-ish language for my 16-bit virtual machine Rusty-VM. I made this assembly language and its parser to allow me and maybe even others to easily create programs for the virtual machine without needing to write raw binary values into a file. It is currently under development, just like the virtual machine itself, so both are far from being finished. Under this paragraph you will find a documentation of the entire language. This documentation will constantly change as more features and content are added to the language.

## Keywords <a name="Keywords"></a>
These are mostly used to determine how the following value will be interpreted.
There are seven keywords: ```routine:```, ```end```, ```lit```, ```hex```, ```num```, ```str``` and ```col```.

### ```routine:``` <a name="routine"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```routine:``` starts the definition of a routine. Example:
```ruby
routine: routine1       # Creates a routine with the name routine1
...
```
</details>

### ```end``` <a name="end"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```end``` is used to mark the end of the routine. Example:
```ruby
...
end      # All that's needed to end the routine definition
```
</details>

### ```var``` <a name="var"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
`var` is used to create variables. Currently a variable can only hold a single value (i.e. not a `str`). Variables can be printed to the screen using `draw var <variable>`. Examples:
```ruby
var age = num 34
var addr = lit 0xBEEF
```
</details>

### ```lit``` <a name="lit"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```lit``` will use the given value as is (thus "lit" for "literal") without any conversion, which is why the value must not be longer than four characters and it must not contain any special symbols; only ```0-9```and ```A-F``` are allowed. Especially useful when   you need to specify addresses. Examples:
```ruby
lit 0x0FA3
lit 0FA3
lit FA3
# These are all the same
```
</details>

### ```hex``` <a name="hex"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```hex``` Interprets the following value as **character**, converting it to its numerical ASCII representation. Examples:
```ruby
load A hex U        # "U" will be converted to 0x0055 and loaded into Register A
load A lit 0x0055   # Same value
```
</details>

### ```num``` <a name="num"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```num``` enables you to use any decimal number from 0 to 65535. Examples:
```ruby
load A num 7        # Number 7 will be loaded into the A register. Would be the same as "lit 0x0007"
load X num 65535    # Number 65535 will be loaded into the X register. Would be the same as "lit 0xFFFF"
```
</details>

### ```str``` <a name="str"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```str``` is currently only used for ```draw```ing and will simply convert each character into a u16 that will be stored into the GPU buffer without interruption. The assembler will automatically add an escape character ("``` ` ```") to the end of the string so the GPU knows when to exit drawing mode. Whitespace is not allowed inside a ```str```, use the character ```^``` instead. Example:
```ruby
draw str Hello^World!  # Will print "Hello World!" to the screen
```
</details>

### ```col``` <a name="col"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```col``` is currently only used for ```draw```ing. It is placed behind a ```str``` to color it. You can also just not use it, then the assembler will default to making the ```str``` white. Example:
```ruby
draw str Hello^World! col red  # Will print a red "Hello World!" to the screen
```
</details>

## Routines <a name="Routines"></a>
```routine: <RoutineName>``` is used to create a routine. Every line below a ```routine: <RoutineName>``` will be part of that routine, until the keyword ```end``` is encountered. ```end```, as the name implies, marks the end of the routine.
All routines **must** be defined before being used. This example program loads the A register with the value 1 and then runs a loop that
increments the value in the A register by 1 for every iteration until it reaches 10000, returns and halts the CPU:
```ruby
routine: loop
radd A num 1
comp reg A num 10000
juin loop      # Jump to routine "loop" if the value in register A isn't equal to 10000
rtor           # Will be reached when the value in register A is equal to 10000
end

routine: entry
load A num 1
jusr loop      # Jump to routine called "loop"
halt           # Routine "loop" returns here when it encounters the "rtor" instruction
end
```

<details>
  <Summary> Detailed explanation </Summary>

  1. In "entry": Loads the A register with the value 1
  2. In "entry": Jumps to a routine called "loop"
  3. In "loop": Add 1 to the value in the A register
  4. In "loop": Compare the value in the A register to 10000, set the eq_flag if true
  5. In "loop": If the eq_flag is **not** set, jump to a routine called "loop" (itself here), otherwise continue
  6. In "loop": "Return to origin" instruction returns to where the program came from, moving on from there
  7. In "entry": Send the CPU into the halt loop, stopping execution

## Instructions <a name="Instructions"></a>
Now it gets interesting. Instructions are key to make the machine do things, so there are (will be) a lot of them

### ```load``` <a name="load"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```load``` is used to load a value into a register. Which register is specified by the first argument, the value by the second. Examples:
```ruby
load A num 7
load X hex H
load Y lit 0x06AF
```
</details>

### ```stor``` <a name="stor"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```stor``` is used to store a value from the register specified by the first argument to the address specified in the second argument. It's also possible to store a registers value to a variable Examples:
```ruby
stor A lit 0x56FA  # Stores the value in the A register to address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory
stor A num 22266
stor A var <variable> # Stores the value in the A register to the specified variable
```
</details>

### ```jump``` <a name="jump"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```jump``` is used to simply jump to a given address. Examples:
```ruby
jump lit 0x56FA    # Jumps to the address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory
jump num 22266     # You can also use a number directly
```
</details>

### ```jusr``` <a name="jusr"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```jusr``` is used just like ```jump``` with the slight difference that it saves the previous position to the stack, allowing the program to return to the previous position using ```rtor```. Examples:
```ruby
jusr lit 0x56FA    # Jumps to the address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory
jusr num 22266     # You can also use a number directly
```
</details>

### ```juie``` <a name="juie"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```juie``` is used just like ```jump``` with the slight difference that it only jumps to the specified address if the CPU's eq_flag is set. Examples:
```ruby
juie lit 0x56FA    # Jumps to the address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory if the eq_flag is set
juie num 22266     # You can also use a number directly
```
</details>

### ```juin``` <a name="juin"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```juin``` is used just like ```jump``` with the slight difference that it only jumps to the specified address if the CPU's eq_flag is **NOT** set. Examples:
```ruby
juin lit 0x56FA    # Jumps to the address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory if the eq_flag is NOT set
juin num 22266     # You can also use a number directly
```
</details>

### ```rtor``` <a name="rtor"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>

```ruby
rtor    # This doesn't take any arguments
```
</details>

### ```brie``` <a name="brie"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
   
```brie``` is used to conditionally jump to a routine with the ability to return to the previous position, here if the equal flag is set. Example:
```ruby
comp num 8 num 9
brie <routine>    # Will not jump to the specified routine

comp num 9 num 9
brie <routine>    # Will jump to the specified routine
```
</details>

### ```brin``` <a name="brin"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
   
```brin``` is used to conditionally jump to a routine with the ability to return to the previous position, here if the equal flag is **NOT** set. Example:
```ruby
comp num 8 num 9
brin <routine>    # Will jump to the specified routine

comp num 9 num 9
brin <routine>    # Will not jump to the specified routine
```
</details>

### ```noop``` <a name="noop"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```noop``` Simply makes the CPU do nothing for one cycle. Example:
```ruby
noop    # Makes the CPU do nothing for one cycle
```
</details>

### ```setv``` <a name="setv"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```setv``` is used to set an address in the memory to the specified value. Examples:
```ruby
setv lit 0x56FA hex U       # Sets the address 0x56FA (the 22266th address) in the memory to the ASCII representation of the character 'U'
setv num 22266 lit 0x0055   # You can also use a number or hex values directly
```
</details>

### ```comp``` <a name="comp"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```comp``` is used to compare two values. If those values are equal, the CPU's eq_flag will be set. The values to be compared can either be registers or specified directly. Examples:
```ruby
comp lit 0x4000 num 8    # Compares the hexadecimal value 0x4000 with the decimal value 8
comp reg A num 8         # Compares the content of register A with the decimal value 8
comp reg A reg X         # Compares two registers
```
</details>

### ```radd``` <a name="radd"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>
  
```radd``` is used to increment a register's value by the following value. Examples:

```
</details>

### ```draw``` <a name="draw"></a>
<details open>
  <Summary> Explanation </Summary>

```draw``` is a versatile instruction used to print things to the VM's monitor. It can be used to print `str` types, the content of registers or variables. It supports colored printing of `str` types. Examples:
```ruby
draw str Hello^World! col green    # Prints a green "Hello World!" to the screen
draw str Hello^World!              # No color specification will default to white
